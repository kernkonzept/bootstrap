L4 Bootstrapper for booting Fiasco and other L4 compatible kernels.

Command line parameters (in alphabetical order):

  -comport=<port>
      If serial logging is enabled, <port> defines which serial port to use,
      where 1 is the first port found.
      NOTE: Bootstrap does not support the -comspeed=<speed> option and uses
      the port with 115200 bps.

  -hercules

  -maxmem=<size in MB>
      Set the mem_upper field of the multiboot info structure.

  -patch=<modname>,<text>=<replacement>,...
      <modname> is compared with the path name of each module to decide which
      module should be patched. If the module was found, each occurrence of
      <text> is replaced by <replacement>. <replacement> can also be quoted
      text. Otherwise no spaces are allowed.
